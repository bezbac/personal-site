After a long time of tweaking this site, I finally sat down to create this first blog post.
And, since I've wanted to have a blog since forever, I could never really put my finger on "why", so I thought it might be a good idea to start with that as the topic of my first post.

Like many others, I've been captivated by the personal websites of all the talented individuals on the web.
There are a lot of personal websites I look at in awe, sometimes I envy them for their seemingly perfect style[^1], sometimes for the creativity behind the presentation[^2] or, of course, for their content[^3].
To me, these websites represent the best of the internet - a space for people to express themselves and share their interests.

Growing up in a world where the internet was already abundant, I've always been drawn to the stories of creators, innovators, and entrepreneurs. I wanted to be part of that world, and now with me working in a startup feel closer to that goal than ever. But there was one thing missing â€“ my little corner of the web.

This blog should be my digital business card - my digital introduction - a place where I can proudly direct people when they ask about my work, my passions, and who I am as a person.

Plus, I just really like building websites.
